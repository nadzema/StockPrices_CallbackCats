        <h1>Best performing Stocks in the S&P 500 that didn't outperform the S&P 500 index:  </h1>
        <p>
            The stocks presented are the best S&P 500 stocks based on future performance that is being compared to the index. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We have included a line chart from the results of our analysis showing how exceptional of a performance these stocks did & still compare them to the index. <br> A line with a positive slope (slant up) shows the change in price over time...meaning you better buy some more stock based on predictions from our Linear Regression Model.
